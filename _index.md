<!-- Dear Brothers and Sisters,

This past week saw NYC enter its Phase 2 in re-opening the city.  We are working on a plan to re-start our in-person meetings at Laburnum.  Many things need to happen before we can meet again, and we will be limited in how we can gather, so we ask for your patience as we work through the details. We will continue to use this Announcement web page to provide any updates as things change.  The links to all our online meetings and children’s classes and videos will be kept up to date.  -->
<!--
Dear Brothers and Sisters,  

Thank you for your continued prayer as we continue to work on re-starting our gathering together in-person at Laburnum.  For us to meet in person, we need to follow the executive order from Governor Cuomo, which limits the number of people allowed to gather indoors in a house of worship.  We also want to follow the guidelines of the Center for Disease Controls and Prevention and the New York State Department of Health.  Please read the following guidelines carefully:  
#### 1) Meetings:
1)	We will have two in-person meetings on the Lord’s Day:  
  a.	The Lord’s Table  
  b.	Message  
2)  We will be meeting in the main meeting hall for the above two meetings. When the meeting hall reaches capacity, attendees will be directed to the 3rd floor  
3)	There will be no children's classes or fellowship groups asides from Junior High and High School classes 
4)	There will be no beverages available during the break  
5)	There will be no lunch served  
#### 2) Lord’s Table:
1)	For those that cannot attend in person, you will be able to join the meeting virtually via Zoom here: [Lord's Table Meeting Link](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/8189379851?pwd=WTY4ajJRL05hVmVBSjEySGVNS2c4UT09)  
Meeting ID: 818 937 9851 / Passcode: 7wySv6  
2)	All those attending, either in person or via Zoom, will be able to participate in prayer.  Prayers will be transmitted so that all can hear and join in.   
3)  For those needing translation of prayers into Chinese, please dial-in to the following number and translation will be provided:  
    Conference dial-in number: (605) 472-5481 / Passcode: 153478  
4)	Hymn and chorus lyrics will be displayed for all to sing along  
5)	Special handling of the bread and cup to minimize contamination will be done  
#### 3) Message:
1)	This meeting will not be via Zoom – it will be Livestreamed from the meeting place  
2)	Link to the message is listed below  
#### 4) Attendees:
1)	For now we are limiting attendance to 152 people between the meeting hall and the 3rd floor.  We will revise this number as the State guidelines change  
2)	Those who are sick or not feeling well should refrain from attending  
3)	Per CDC guidelines, we are asking those that are 65 years old and above to NOT attend in person.  The only exception will be for those who have been vaccinated.  
4)	We will not have children’s classes, and all other rooms, asides from the meeting hall, 2nd floor overflow room, 3rd floor, library, and bathrooms, will not be open for use.  We feel that most children under 6th grade will have difficulty sitting through 2 full hours of meetings and suggest they stay home.  However, if you feel you want your child(ren) to attend, they must be with you at all times. Asides from the break and bathroom needs, they will need to be in the main hall with you for the duration of the meetings.  
5)	Only those who receive a confirmation email after filling out the Google Form below (listed under point #9 -- Next Steps) will be allowed to attend.   
6)	Attendees should be willing to help in practical areas related to ushering, the Lord's Table, and cleaning. From the attendance list, you may be asked to help in these areas.  
7)  Please arrive by 9:50 AM -- doors will be locked promptly at 10:00 AM  
#### 5) Social Distancing:
1)	All attendees will be required to wear face masks at all times inside the building.  If you do not have your own, masks will be provided  
2)  We are no longer requiring the use of gloves -- it is now voluntary.  We are however, requiring all to use the provided hand sanitizer station to clean your hands upon entry  
3)	All attendees will be scanned with a thermometer.  If there is any indication of a fever, you will not be allowed to attend  
4)	Seating will be arranged six feet apart.  Members of the immediate family can be seated together  
5)	Tape and signs to reduce bi-directional foot traffic will be posted – please adhere to the directions  
6)	Please remain at least 6 feet apart at all times  
7) Please do not hang your outer coats on the racks -- keep your coats with you at all times
#### 6) Bathroom Use:
1)	To ensure adequate social distancing, brothers will use both bathrooms on the second floor.  Sisters will use the three bathrooms in the basement.  
2)	Only one person allowed in the bathroom at one time  
3)	Social distance of six feet will be enforced while in line for the bathroom  
#### 7) Hygiene:
1)	We will be conducting regular cleaning and disinfection of the building after the message time (Those helping with cleaning need to be able to stay after the message. At least six brothers/sisters are needed for cleaning)  
2)	Doors will be propped open to minimize touchpoints  
3)	No drinking from the water fountain  
4)	No eating or drinking allowed inside the building  
#### 8) Contact Tracing:
1)	We will need to maintain a log of each person attending to trace and notify in the case an attendee is diagnosed with Covid-19  
2)	You will need to fill out the Google Form with your information -- the link to the form is listed below under point #9 -- Next Steps   
#### 9) Next Steps:
1)  For all who want to attend in-person in May, please fill out this [Sign-up Google form for the month of May](https://forms.gle/sFAHdfVLokkDtqzf9)  
2)  Please fill out your attendance for the entire month.  If you decide to sign-up after the first week of the month, please make sure you sign-up at least 5 days before the day you want to attend so we can accommodate you.
3)	We will subsequently send an email to you to confirm your attendance  
4)  VERY IMPORTANT:  ONLY if you receive a confirmation email will you be allowed to attend.  If you do not receive an email, please do not come to the building.  Same day walk-ins will not be allowed to attend either.  -->

### SUNDAY SCHOOL INFORMATION
----------------
<!-- In this section you will find information for each Sunday School class.  -->
All Sunday School classes will meet at CBM Sunday morning after the Lord's Table meeting (approx. 11:20am).   This includes Nursery Class, Toddler Class, Pre-K/Kindergarten Class, 1st/2nd Grade Class, 3rd/4th Grade Class, 5th/6th Grade Class, Jr. High Class and High School. 
<!--
* **Nursery Class**  
To all parents of nursery age children: We miss all your little ones in class and hope that this playlist can help keep the songs we sing in their minds and hearts. Our intention is to reinforce these songs that they already know and provide consistency so we will not change the songs on the playlist. Please feel free to play it for them each Sunday, or any other time you desire.
