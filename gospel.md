##  Love with Eyes Wide Open:

*"And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." Mark 10:21*


In these times of turbulence and uncertainty, it is good to know that God’s love for each of us is a sure thing and that His love is of the most noble kind.  Much of our understanding of love comes from what Jesus taught and demonstrated when He was here on earth 2,000 years ago.

 
Even while many are celebrating the birth of Jesus in this holiday season, we will take some time to consider the good news about the love of God that Jesus taught us and showed us.


Humanly speaking, it is NOT in us to always have peace in the midst of the storm.  Many little episodes in our regular existence, let alone during this unprecedented crisis, attest to our vulnerability and restlessness. 


**Love with Eyes Wide Open:**  What to do you think we mean by this title?
Well, come join us to find out.

*Yet, on the night of His betrayal, Christ Jesus offered His surpassing peace to His disciples,* **“Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, do I give to you.  Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.” (John 14:27)** 

God wants you to have the peace that only His Son Jesus can offer. We cordially invite you to hear *the Gospel of His grace on*
